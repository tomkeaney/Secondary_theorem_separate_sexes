    "text": "Selecting data appropriate for analysis\nWe conducted a near-exhaustive search of the literature until January 2022, to obtain line mean estimates and associated meta-data for quantitative traits that have been measured in the DGRP. We did not include data collected for traits that had been measured in heterozygous combinations of multiple DGRP lines. To ready the data for analysis, we grouped trait values by trait and sex and standardised the data to have mean = 0 and sd = 1. Sex-specific standardised line means for each trait were then joined with their standardised fitness estimates, obtained from Wong and Holman (2023). We also include some helpful metadata for downstream analysis. We then pruned the dataset to only include traits that have been measured in single-sex cohorts, in 80 or more lines. We also removed traits included in two large datasets on the microbiome and metabolome (Everett et al. 2020 and Jin et al. 2020).\n\n\nShow the code\n# load in the data, note that traits have already been standardised\n\nDGRP_data &lt;- \n  left_join(\n    read_csv(\"data/data_collation/output/all.dgrp.phenos_scaled.csv\") %&gt;% \n      mutate(line = as.factor(line)),\n    read_csv(\"data/data_collation/output/meta_data_for_all_traits.csv\") %&gt;%\n      group_by(Reference) %&gt;% \n      mutate(study_ID = as.factor(cur_group_id()),\n             Pooled = if_else(Sex == \"Pooled\", \"Yes\", \"No\"))) %&gt;% \n  left_join(read_rds(\"data/trait_names.rds\")) %&gt;% \n  mutate(Trait_nice = case_when(Sex == \"Female\" ~ paste(Trait_nice, \"(F)\", sep = \" \"),\n                                Sex == \"Male\" ~ paste(Trait_nice, \"(M)\", sep = \" \"),\n                                .default = Trait_nice))\n  \n  \n# Apply the selection criteria with the filter() function, then add a column each for female and male fitness\n\ntrait_data &lt;-\n  DGRP_data %&gt;%  \n  filter(!str_detect(Trait, \"fitness\"),\n         `# lines measured` &gt;= 80 &\n           Pooled != \"Yes\" & \n           Reference != \"Jin et al (2020) PLOS Genetics\" & \n           Reference != \"Everett et al (2020) Genome Research\") %&gt;% \n  # join the early life fitness data from Wong and Holman\n  left_join(\n    DGRP_data %&gt;%\n      filter(str_detect(Trait, \"fitness.early.life\")) %&gt;% \n      select(line, Trait, trait_value) %&gt;% \n      pivot_wider(names_from = Trait, values_from = trait_value) %&gt;% \n      rename(female_fitness = fitness.early.life.f, male_fitness = fitness.early.life.m))\n\nclean_meta_data &lt;-\n  trait_data %&gt;% \n  select(Trait_nice, Trait, Life_stage, `Trait guild`, study_ID, Trait_nice, Reference, `Trait description`) %&gt;% \n  distinct(Trait, .keep_all = TRUE) %&gt;% \n    mutate(Trait_nice = case_when(Trait_nice == \"DDT resistance mortality\" ~ \"DDT susceptibility\",\n                                  .default = Trait_nice)) # make confusing name simpler\n\n\nTable S1.

    "text": "Estimating \\(R\\): the response to selection\nThe response to selection can be predicted via the Robertson covariance (Robertson, 1968), \\(\\Delta z = \\sigma(A_w, A_z)\\), where \\(\\Delta z\\) is the between generational change in the mean of a trait and \\(A_w\\) and \\(A_z\\) are breeding values for fitness and the trait in the current generation. It is also possible to write a sex-partitioned version of the Robertson covariance (Geeta Arun et al., In preparation) which similarly illustrates that \\(\\Delta z\\) is the average of the evolutionary change that occurs following selection on males and females. The partial evolutionary change for the ith female or male trait is\n\\[\n\\Delta \\overline{z_{Fi}} = \\frac{1}{2}(\\sigma(A_{wF, A_{zFi}}) + (\\sigma(A_{wM}, A_{zFi})))\n\\tag{1}\\]\n\\[\n\\Delta \\overline{z_{Mi}} = \\frac{1}{2}(\\sigma(A_{wM, A_{zMi}}) + (\\sigma(A_{wF}, A_{zMi})))\n\\tag{2}\\]\nHere, we empirically estimate the genetic covariance terms in Equations 1 and 2 for many traits, which convey the female and male components of the overall evolutionary change in each male or female trait. Combining Equations 2 and 3 and writing \\(R_{FF}\\) for the evolutionary response of a female trait due to selection on females, we find\n\\[\nR_{FF} = \\sigma(A_{wF}, A_{zFi})\n\\tag{3}\\]\nSimilarly, we can estimate the evolutionary response of a female trait to selection on males as\n\\[\nR_{MF} = \\sigma(A_{wM}, A_{zFi})\n\\tag{4}\\]\nand the evolutionary response of a male trait to selection on males\n\\[\nR_{MM} = \\sigma(A_{wM}, A_{zMi})\n\\tag{5}\\]\nand selection on females\n\\[\nR_{FM} = \\sigma(A_{wF}, A_{zMi})\n\\tag{6}\\]\n\nBuild models to calculate \\(R_{FF}\\) & \\(R_{MF}\\)\nTo estimate the covariance between \\(A_w\\) and \\(A_z\\), we fitted bivariate Bayesian linear models using the brms package (Bürkner, 2017) for R version 4.2.2. For each combination of trait and sex, we used line means for the focal trait and the fitness of the focal sex as the two response variables and fitted an intercept-only Gaussian model. Each model returned a posterior distribution of the residual correlation between trait and fitness, which for data expressed in standard units is equivalent to the covariance.\nBuild functions to run the models\n\n\nShow the code\n# RFF estimates\n\nfemale_traits &lt;- trait_data %&gt;% filter(Sex == \"Female\")\n\ntrait_list_female &lt;- unique(female_traits$Trait) # an input to the map_dfr() function that we'll need in a few chunks time\n\n# code the model structure we will use for all traits using one example - `flight.performance.f`.

We consider evidence ratios &gt; 39 or &lt; 1/39 as biologically notable (without accounting for multiple testing), as our hypothesis is two-directional (negative and positive values of \\(R\\) are of interest to us) and these values closely correspond to the familiar frequentist p-value = 0.05 (Makowski et al, 2019).\n\n\nShow the code\n# build a function to calculate the evidence ratio, get the relevant info from the output and convert it to a tibble\n\nfind_evidence_ratios &lt;- function(Trait_name, specify_hypothesis){\n  x &lt;- hypothesis(R_all_traits %&gt;% \n                    filter(Trait == Trait_name),\n                  specify_hypothesis)\n  \n  x &lt;- x$hypothesis\n  \n  x %&gt;% as_tibble() %&gt;% \n    select(Evid.Ratio) %&gt;% \n    mutate(Trait = Trait_name)\n}\n\n# list of traits we need evidence ratios for.\n\nall_traits_list &lt;- R_all_traits %&gt;% distinct(Trait) %&gt;% pull(Trait)\n\n# calculate evidence ratios \n\nif(!file.exists(\"data/organismal_level_output/organismal_level_evidence_ratios.csv\")){\n\nR_evidence_ratios_female &lt;- \n  map_dfr(all_traits_list, \n          find_evidence_ratios, \n          \"Response_to_selection_female &gt; 0\") %&gt;% \n  rename(Female_Evid_Ratio = Evid.Ratio)\n\nR_evidence_ratios_male &lt;-\n  map_dfr(all_traits_list, \n          find_evidence_ratios, \n          \"Response_to_selection_male &gt; 0\") %&gt;% \n  rename(Male_Evid_Ratio = Evid.Ratio)\n\nR_evidence_ratios_overall &lt;- \n    map_dfr(all_traits_list, \n          find_evidence_ratios, \n          \"R_overall &gt; 0\") %&gt;% \n  rename(Overall_Evid_Ratio = Evid.Ratio)\n\nR_evidence_ratios_diff &lt;- \n    map_dfr(all_traits_list, \n          find_evidence_ratios, \n          \"R_diff &gt; 0\") %&gt;% \n  rename(Diff_Evid_Ratio = Evid.Ratio)\n}\n\n\nNext, we manually calculate evidence ratios for sexually concordant responses to selection by:\n\nUsing the p_direction function from the bayestestR package, we find the proportion of the posterior distribution (the posterior probability) that is of the median’s sign for each trait in each sex.\nUsing the p_direction output, we calculate the probability that a trait has positive \\(R\\), \\(P(pos)\\) or negative \\(R\\), \\(P(neg) = 1 - P(pos)\\).\nFind \\(P(concord) = P(pos)_f P(pos)_m + P(neg)_f P(neg)_m\\)\nFind \\(P(antag) = P(pos)_f P(neg)_m + P(neg)_f P(pos)_m\\)\nTake the ratio of \\(P(concord)\\) and \\(P(antag)\\)\n\nEvidence ratios &gt; 1 indicate that the response to selection is more likely to be sexually concordant, whereas ratios &lt; 1 indicate a sexually antagonistic response has higher probability. As indicated by step 3, a concordant response is possible when the trait responds to selection in either a negative or positive direction in both sexes. Similarly, step 4 shows that an antagonistic response is also possible via two paths.

The dotted lines indicate an evidence ratio of 39 or 1/39; these correspond strongly with the frequentist \\(p\\) = 0.05. Traits with ER &gt; 39 or &lt; 1/39 are labelled."

    "text": "Selecting data appropriate for analysis\nWe use the data archived on the dgrp2 website, which was provided by Huang et al. (2015). These data are levels of expression of genes measured across 185 DGRP lines. Huang et al’s data contains Y-linked genes that have higher/equal expression in females in all lines, presumably microarray issues/errors. To be conservative, we restrict our analyses to genes that are known to be on chromosomes that are present in both sexes. After data cleaning, we retain 14,268 genes in our analysis.\nWe also load gene annotation data downloaded from GenBank using the org.Dm.eg.db R package provided by BiocManager.

For each combination of trait/transcript and sex, we used line means for the focal trait/transcript and the fitness of the focal sex as the two response variables and fitted an intercept-only Gaussian model.

The dashed lines indicate an evidence ratio of 1, where the probability that \\(R\\) &gt; 0 is equal to the probability that \\(R\\) &lt; 0. ER &gt; 1 indicates a positive response is more likely, whereas ER &lt; 1 indicates a negative response is more likely. The upper dotted line on each plot indicates an evidence ratio of 39, while the lower dotted line indicates an evidence ratio of 1/39; these correspond strongly with the frequentist \\(p\\) = 0.05. Genes represented by large points with black outlines indicate very extreme cases where evidence ratios could not be calculated, as the entire posterior distribution was found on one side of zero.

    "text": "Estimate the correlation between \\(R_F\\) and \\(R_M\\)\nTo estimate the correlation between the evolutionary response to selection on females and males, while accounting for measurement error in selection response estimates, we use a bootstrapping approach. For each trait, we generate an \\(R_F\\) and \\(R_M\\) estimate, drawn from a normal distribution, parameterised with the mean and standard error we have empirically estimated. We then calculate the correlation for this particular draw of trait values. We repeat this process 10,000 times, and find the median correlation with associated 2.5% and 97.5% uncertainty intervals.\n\n\nShow the code\nR_medians &lt;-\n  R_long_form %&gt;%\n  group_by(Trait, Fitness_Sex, Trait_Sex) %&gt;% \n  summarise_draws(\"median\", \"sd\", ~quantile(.x, probs = c(0.025, 0.975), na.rm = TRUE)) %&gt;% \n  ungroup() %&gt;% \n  select(-c(variable))\n\nR_medians_summarised_transcriptome &lt;-\n  R_summarised_transcriptome %&gt;% \n  select(Trait, Trait_Sex, Fitness_Sex, median, sd) %&gt;% \n  pivot_wider(names_from = c(Fitness_Sex), values_from = 4:5) \n\nget_bootstrap_cor_transcriptome &lt;- function(){\n  \n  x &lt;- R_medians_summarised_transcriptome %&gt;% \n    mutate(boot_f = rnorm(28536, median_Female, sd_Female), # draw from the R_F distribution of each trait\n           boot_m = rnorm(28536, median_Male, sd_Male)) # draw from the R_M distribution of each trait\n  \n  cor(x$boot_f, x$boot_m, method = \"spearman\")\n}\n\n# generate the correlation 10,000 times, using different draws each time\nif(!file.exists(\"data/transcriptome_output/R_between_sex_correlation_transcriptome.csv\")){\n  R_between_sex_correlation_transcriptome &lt;- tibble(cor = lapply(1:10000, function(x) get_bootstrap_cor_transcriptome()) %&gt;% \n                                                      unlist())\n  \n  write_csv(R_between_sex_correlation_transcriptome, \"data/transcriptome_output/R_between_sex_correlation_transcriptome.csv\")\n} else{\n  R_between_sex_correlation_transcriptome &lt;- read_delim(\"data/transcriptome_output/R_between_sex_correlation_transcriptome.csv\", delim = \" \")}\n\nSummary_R_between_sex_correlation_transcriptome &lt;- median_qi(R_between_sex_correlation_transcriptome) %&gt;% \n  select(1:3) %&gt;% \n  rename(`Correlation median estimate` = cor,\n         `2.5% uncertainty interval` = .lower,\n         `97.5% uncertainty interval` = .upper)\n\nSummary_R_between_sex_correlation_transcriptome %&gt;% \n  mutate(across(1:3, ~ round(.x, 3))) %&gt;% \n  pander(split.cell = 40, split.table = Inf)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorrelation median estimate\n2.5% uncertainty interval\n97.5% uncertainty interval\n\n\n\n\n0.08\n0.07\n0.09"

    "text": "Testing for a difference in mean genetic variance between male and female traits\n\nCalculating genetic variance and the coefficient of genetic variation\nThe following code chunk first compiles a list of male and female traits for which a similar trait was measured in both sexes, by a single study, and then excludes all traits where this condition was not met. For example, Schmidt et al (2017) measured “DDT resistance knockdown” in both sexes in separate assays, and so we kept DDT resistance knockdown (female) and DDT resistance knockdown (male) in the dataset.\nFor each male or female trait, we then calculate the variance in line mean trait values, \\(\\sigma_L^2\\). \\(\\sigma_L^2\\) approximates the genetic variance (i.e. the variance in breeding values), since line means are estimates of the breeding value of that line’s genotype.\nWe additionally calculated the coefficient of genetic variation (\\(CV_G\\)), defined as \\(100\\sigma_L^2/\\mu\\), where \\(\\mu\\) is the mean of the line means. This quantity was only calculated for traits where \\(\\mu\\) was positive. We also excluded traits where \\(\\mu\\) &lt; 0.0001, since many of these traits appeared to have been mean-centered by the original authors (with rounding error explaining why \\(\\mu\\) was not exactly zero).\nFinally, for both the dataset of \\(\\sigma_L^2\\) estimates and the dataset of \\(CV_G\\) estimates, we produced a reduced dataset that retained only a single randomly-selected pair of matching male and female traits per study.

    "text": "Testing for sex effects on mean genetic covariance between traits\n\nCalculate genetic covariances between pairs of traits\nThis analysis does not use all the traits in our dataset, because trait pairs measured in the same study (and often the same individuals) may be especially similar due to confounding environmental sources of phenotypic covariance, which would inflate estimates of the genetic covariance. To deal with this issue simply and robustly, we randomly retained a single trait (which could be either male or female) per study, and discarded all other traits. Only traits measured in at least 80 lines are used in this analysis, and the line means were scaled to mean=0, variance=1 prior to analysis.\nWe then calculate the covariance in line means (using all pairwise complete observations), which is an estimate of the genetic covariance (given that line means are estimates of the breeding values). Each calculated covariance is then classified as either a female-female, male-male, or between-sex covariance for subsequent statistical testing and plotting.\n\n\nShow the code\n# Get a single random male or female trait per study \n# (only including traits measured in at least 80 lines)\n# Scale all the line means to mean=0, variance=1\nall_traits &lt;- trait_data_unscaled %&gt;% \n  filter(Trait %in% get_independent_traits()) %&gt;% \n  select(line, Trait, trait_value) %&gt;% \n  distinct(.keep_all = T) %&gt;% \n  spread(Trait, trait_value) %&gt;% \n  select(-line) %&gt;% \n # as.data.frame() %&gt;% \n  mutate_all(~ as.numeric(scale(.x)))\n\n# Calculate all pairwise covariances between traits\ncovs &lt;- cov(all_traits, \n            use = \"pairwise.complete.obs\") %&gt;%\n  as.data.frame() %&gt;% \n  rownames_to_column() %&gt;% \n  gather(trait, cov, -rowname) %&gt;% \n  as_tibble() %&gt;% \n  rename(trait1 = rowname, trait2 = trait) %&gt;% \n  mutate(sex1 = substr(trait1, nchar(trait1)-1, nchar(trait1)),\n         sex2 = substr(trait2, nchar(trait2)-1, nchar(trait2))) %&gt;% \n  filter((sex1 %in% c(\".m\", \".f\")) & (sex2 %in% c(\".m\", \".f\"))) %&gt;% \n  mutate(sex_combo = paste(sex1, sex2), trait_combo=\"a\")\n\n# Create a trait_combo column that labels each unique pair of traits\n# Necessary because G_f and G_m are symmetrical, and we don't want to double-count these covariances \nfor(i in 1:nrow(covs)) {\n  covs$trait_combo[i] &lt;- paste0(\n    sort(c(covs$trait1[i],\n           covs$trait2[i])), collapse = \"~\")\n}\n\n\n\n\nTest for sex effects on genetic covariance\nThe following statistical test examines the null hypothesis that there is no difference in mean genetic covariance between 3 kinds of trait pairs: pairs of female traits, pairs of male traits, and pairs in which one is a female trait and one a male trait (i.e elements of \\(G_f\\), \\(G_m\\) and \\(B\\) respectively).

There appear to be some lines that have been used in very few studies, suggesting some of these lines reflect labelling errors.\nAfter checking the Bloomington Drosophila Stock Centre and Flybase we found the following anomalies:\n\nChapman et al (2020): lines 273, 331, 501, 568, 709, 831, 846 - these lines are not phenotyped in any other study and are not documented on flybase.\nPalmer et al (2018): line 575 - not on Flybase\nChowdhury et al (2019): line 471 - not on Flybase (only aberrant line from study)\nHouston (2019): line 285 - not on Flybase\nWatanabe and Riddle (2021): line 854 - not on Flybase\nBattlay et al (2016): lines 226, 847 and 917 - there is no obvious reason for these mysterious lines. There are no obvious typos and the paper states they conduct GWA with 178 lines, which matches the number reported in File S2, which is where we sourced the data.\nKatzenberger et al (2015): line 521 - no obvious typo (data is ordered by increasing trait value). One-off issue. Not on Flybase.\nTurner, Miller and Cochrane (2013): line 760 - no obvious typo. One off. Not on Flybase.\nMontgomery et al (2014): lines 424 and 766 - Errors appear to be mislabelled lines. Table S3 includes RAL lines 424 and 766. Line 766 is out of numeric order in the Table. Most likely to actually be line 776 or 786, but we cannot be sure.\nHe et al (2014): Bloomington stock number 28120 - Error appears to be a typo. Line 28120 is included in the raw data, but isn’t listed in Table S2 which shows the lines used in the study. One-off issue.\nLafluente, Duneau and Beldade (2018): line 809 - Likely to be a typo or a labelling error.

However, the DGRP record on Flybase (http://flybase.org/reports/FBlc0000504.html) indicates that a total of 219 lines have been included in the DGRP at some point since its creation. We infer that some lines were withdrawn from the Bloomington stock centre, explaining their absence from most DGRP studies.\nThe lines that have been withdrawn but are included in our dataset are: 80, 272, 343, 378, 387, 393, 398, 476, 514, 554, 556, 591, 750, 771. We chose not to remove these lines from our dataset, as many of the studies we include in our dataset make use of these lines.\n\n\n\nSome studies report data that has been previously used (in a way that we missed in our initial data collection), leading to perfect or near perfect correlations between traits. We here remove one such duplicate trait.\nAnother study includes data that we entered into the database incorrectly: one trait was measured in 10 lines (below our cutoff) but was entered for 99 lines.

This generally occurs when the goal of a study is to observe whether genetic variation affects the response to a genetic disease encoded by a particular variant or the expression of a transgenic construct. These studies are not ideal for our database, as the phenotypes they observe may be affected be dominance and epistatic interactions that are absent in the nearly completely homozygous DGRP lines.

We fixed these datasets in the original spreadsheet before it entered R, but document our fixes here for transparency.\n\nUnckless, Rottschaefer and Lazzaro (2015, G3) include line 287 twice in their provided data. The trait values were identical, so we simply removed the duplication.\nChow, Wolfner and Clark (2013, PNAS) include line 287 twice in their data (coincidence?). They measured two traits: a hazard ratio for tunicamycin-induced survival and an LT50 value. Line 287 has two different hazard ratios, but the same LT50 value. We therefore removed line 287 completely from the hazard ratio dataset, but only removed the duplicate in the LT50 dataset.\nHotson and Schneider (2015, G3) include line 712 twice in their provided data, for the trait L.monocytogenes.load.m. The duplicates provide different values. Due to this ambiguity, we removed line 712 from the dataset.\nAdebambo et al (2020, Frontiers in Genetics) include the line 229 twice. The trait values were identical, so we simply removed the duplication.\n\n\n\nShow the code\n# the code below reports lines that have &gt; 1 measurement for any of the traits in our dataset \n\n# If there are 0 rows in the tibble, it means no errors remain\nproblems &lt;- all.dgrp.phenos_combined_subset %&gt;% \n  group_by(line, Trait) %&gt;% \n  summarise(n = n()) %&gt;% \n  arrange(-n) %&gt;% \n  filter(n &gt; 1)\n\n\n\n\n\nHere, we save the {r n_traits_after_cleaning} traits as a .csv file called data/derived/all.dgrp.phenos_unscaled.csv, which you may wish to download and use in your research.

    "text": "We have phenotype line means for {r num_unique_lines} lines, which is more than we expected. There appear to be some lines that have been used in very few studies, suggesting some of these lines reflect labelling errors.\nAfter checking the Bloomington Drosophila Stock Centre and Flybase we found the following anomalies:\n\nChapman et al (2020): lines 273, 331, 501, 568, 709, 831, 846 - these lines are not phenotyped in any other study and are not documented on flybase.\nPalmer et al (2018): line 575 - not on Flybase\nChowdhury et al (2019): line 471 - not on Flybase (only aberrant line from study)\nHouston (2019): line 285 - not on Flybase\nWatanabe and Riddle (2021): line 854 - not on Flybase\nBattlay et al (2016): lines 226, 847 and 917 - there is no obvious reason for these mysterious lines. There are no obvious typos and the paper states they conduct GWA with 178 lines, which matches the number reported in File S2, which is where we sourced the data.\nKatzenberger et al (2015): line 521 - no obvious typo (data is ordered by increasing trait value). One-off issue. Not on Flybase.\nTurner, Miller and Cochrane (2013): line 760 - no obvious typo. One off. Not on Flybase.\nMontgomery et al (2014): lines 424 and 766 - Errors appear to be mislabelled lines. Table S3 includes RAL lines 424 and 766. Line 766 is out of numeric order in the Table. Most likely to actually be line 776 or 786, but we cannot be sure.\nHe et al (2014): Bloomington stock number 28120 - Error appears to be a typo. Line 28120 is included in the raw data, but isn’t listed in Table S2 which shows the lines used in the study. One-off issue.\nLafluente, Duneau and Beldade (2018): line 809 - Likely to be a typo or a labelling error. One-off issue.\n\nThe following code removes these putatively erroneous lines from the dataset:\n\n\nShow the code\n# check how many traits each line has been phenotyped for\nline_test &lt;- all.dgrp.phenos_combined %&gt;% group_by(line) %&gt;% \n  summarise(n_traits = length(Trait)) %&gt;% \n  arrange(n_traits)\n\n# check specific lines\n\n#print(all.dgrp.phenos_combined %&gt;% \n # filter(line == \"556\"), n = 31)\n\n# remove the aberrant lines\naberrant_lines &lt;- c(226, 273, 285, 331, 424, 471, 501, \n                    521, 568, 575, 709, 760, 766, 809, \n                    831, 846, 847, 854, 917)\n\nall.dgrp.phenos_combined &lt;-\n  all.dgrp.phenos_combined %&gt;% \n  filter(!(line %in% aberrant_lines))\n\n\nThis still leaves 219 lines, which was unexpected because most studies state that the DGRP consists of 205 lines. However, the DGRP record on Flybase (http://flybase.org/reports/FBlc0000504.html) indicates that a total of 219 lines have been included in the DGRP at some point since its creation. We infer that some lines were withdrawn from the Bloomington stock centre, explaining their absence from most DGRP studies.\nThe lines that have been withdrawn but are included in our dataset are: 80, 272, 343, 378, 387, 393, 398, 476, 514, 554, 556, 591, 750, 771. We chose not to remove these lines from our dataset, as many of the studies we include in our dataset make use of these lines.\n\n\n\nSome studies report data that has been previously used (in a way that we missed in our initial data collection), leading to perfect or near perfect correlations between traits. We here remove one such duplicate trait.\nAnother study includes data that we entered into the database incorrectly: one trait was measured in 10 lines (below our cutoff) but was entered for 99 lines. We remove this error from the dataset.\n\n\nShow the code\nall.dgrp.phenos_combined_subset &lt;-\n  all.dgrp.phenos_combined %&gt;% filter(Trait != \"rapid.cold.hardening.25C\",\n                                      Trait != \"dopamine.response.to.paraquat.2021.m\")\n\n\n\n\n\nSome traits have been measured in heterozygotes. This generally occurs when the goal of a study is to observe whether genetic variation affects the response to a genetic disease encoded by a particular variant or the expression of a transgenic construct. These studies are not ideal for our database, as the phenotypes they observe may be affected be dominance and epistatic interactions that are absent in the nearly completely homozygous DGRP lines. We remove these studies from our dataset.\n\n\nShow the code\n# Remove traits measured in heterozyogtes and traits entered incorrectly\n\nall.dgrp.phenos_combined_subset &lt;- all.dgrp.phenos_combined_subset %&gt;% \n  filter(Trait != \"recombination.rate.3R.f\", \n         Trait != \"recombination.rate.X.f\", \n         Trait != \"eye.area.diabetes.susceptibility.2014a.m\", \n         Trait != \"eye.area.diabetes.susceptibility.2014a.f\",\n         Trait != \"eye.area.Drop.susceptibility.2014a.f\", \n         Trait != \"eye.area.Drop.susceptibility.2014a.m\", \n         Trait != \"eye.area.Lobe.susceptibility.2014a.f\", \n         Trait != \"eye.area.Lobe.susceptibility.2014a.m\", \n         Trait != \"notum.bristles.diabetes.susceptibility.2014a.f\", \n         Trait != \"notum.bristles.diabetes.susceptibility.2014a.m\", \n         Trait != \"CRISPR.full.resistance.embryo.formation.f\", \n         Trait != \"CRISPR.germline.conversion.rate.f\", \n         Trait != \"CRISPR.mosaic.resistance.embryo.formation.f\", \n         Trait != \"CRISPR.wildtype.rate.m\", \n         Trait != \"Canton S(B).olfactory.response.benzaldehyde.f\", \n         Trait != \"neur.olfactory.response.benzaldehyde.f\", \n         Trait != \"Sema5c.olfactory.response.benzaldehyde.f\") \n\n\n\n\n\nFor some traits, a small number of lines had &gt;1 trait value. We fixed these datasets in the original spreadsheet before it entered R, but document our fixes here for transparency.\n\nUnckless, Rottschaefer and Lazzaro (2015, G3) include line 287 twice in their provided data. The trait values were identical, so we simply removed the duplication.\nChow, Wolfner and Clark (2013, PNAS) include line 287 twice in their data (coincidence?). They measured two traits: a hazard ratio for tunicamycin-induced survival and an LT50 value. Line 287 has two different hazard ratios, but the same LT50 value. We therefore removed line 287 completely from the hazard ratio dataset, but only removed the duplicate in the LT50 dataset.\nHotson and Schneider (2015, G3) include line 712 twice in their provided data, for the trait L.monocytogenes.load.m. The duplicates provide different values. Due to this ambiguity, we removed line 712 from the dataset.\nAdebambo et al (2020, Frontiers in Genetics) include the line 229 twice. The trait values were identical, so we simply removed the duplication.\n\n\n\nShow the code\n# the code below reports lines that have &gt; 1 measurement for any of the traits in our dataset \n\n# If there are 0 rows in the tibble, it means no errors remain\nproblems &lt;- all.dgrp.phenos_combined_subset %&gt;% \n  group_by(line, Trait) %&gt;% \n  summarise(n = n()) %&gt;% \n  arrange(-n) %&gt;% \n  filter(n &gt; 1)\n\n\n\n\n\nHere, we save the {r n_traits_after_cleaning} traits as a .csv file called data/derived/all.dgrp.phenos_unscaled.csv, which you may wish to download and use in your research.

It accompanies the manuscript “The complication of sex: estimating adaptation when selection acts on females and males” in review at Evolution, and is designed so that our methods can be fully reproduced with relative ease. The data collation tab contains information on our dataset and documents how it was quality controlled. Our analysis relies on using the mean phenotypic values for near-isogenic lines of flies. Each line carries a single genotype so these phenotypic means can be used as estimates of breeding values. The ‘Finding line means’ tab documents the statistical modelling we used to find line means when only raw, individual level data was provided by the original study.

The statistical analysis presented in Fig.1b uses these models simplified by removal of non-significant factors.”\nWe follow this approach to best recapitulate the study’s analysis, except that we allow the intercept for the random effect line to vary with microbiota treatment. This is needed in our modelling approach to estimate line-specific effects of microbiota. We also include day as a blocking factor, which represents a block of data collection involving a subset of lines. This controls for micro-environmental variance between blocks of phenotyping.\n\n\nShow the code\n# weight\n\nDobson_NI_microbiome.dryweight &lt;- read_csv(\"data/data_collation/input/Raw_data_files/Dobson_2015/gwasB.filtered.dw.ab.csv\") %&gt;% \n  mutate(line = as.factor(str_remove(RAL, \"RAL_\")),\n         wolb = as.factor(wolb),\n         trt = as.factor(trt),\n         day = as.factor(day),\n         # standardise\n         st_weight.5.flies = my_scale(weight.5.flies)) %&gt;% \n  select(-c(PC1, PC2, PC3, Code, RAL, ...1))\n\n# The data is a bit tricky.

The response is a learning score that is bounded between -100 to 100. It is the percentage of flies that approached a trained target compared with a control target. Negative values indicate that the flies preferred the control target; positive values indicate a preference for the trained target. This data generating process can be approximated using the beta distribution. However, we need to re-express the data so that it falls between 0 and 1.\nThe authors calculate the learning score using the formula \\(learning.score =\\frac{(Trained.odour - Control.odour)*100}{Trained.odour + control.odour}\\).

This model struggles to converge using brms, so we treat the data as time to event with right censoring for the flies that failed to mate within a 2 hour window (coded as 120 in the dataset). To model this data we fit a survival model, specifying a weibull distribution.\nTo model insemination capacity Dean et al specify a quasipoisson distribution family because they treat the data as underdispersed counts. There is no family like this in brms. However, we can treat the data as binomial, with each female treated as a YES/NO for mating success. The posterior predictive check suggests this is a good fit to the data.

This is because some lines are resistant to parathion, leading to heavy sensoring. This results in two groups of lines: those that are susceptible and those that are resistant. The resistant lines have estimated mean survival times of 400+ days, which is not realistic for D. melanogaster.

    "text": "Some studies/authors provided the raw data that was collected when measuring DGRP phenotypes (e.g. measurements of individual flies), although we need line mean data to calculate the response to selection. To get line means, we fitted Bayesian mixed effect models and used these to estimate mean trait values for each line, using the model formula that made the most sense to us given the study’s experimental design (see annotations in the code below). Often, but not always, this conformed with the original analysis. Our analyses of each paper’s data are presented in a separate tab below.\nWhere the response follows a Gaussian distribution, we standardise the response to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1, in order to make prior specification more straightforward. In these cases, the estimated line means are converted back to the response scale.\nThe Bayesian models won’t run unless you have stan and the brms package installed. To install stan follow these instructions."

The statistical analysis presented in Fig.1b uses these models simplified by removal of non-significant factors.”\nWe follow this approach to best recapitulate the study’s analysis, except that we allow the intercept for the random effect line to vary with microbiota treatment. This is needed in our modelling approach to estimate line-specific effects of microbiota.

The response is a learning score that is bounded between -100 to 100. It is the percentage of flies that approached a trained target compared with a control target. Negative values indicate that the flies preferred the control target; positive values indicate a preference for the trained target. This data generating process can be approximated using the beta distribution. However, we need to re-express the data so that it falls between 0 and 1.\nThe authors calculate the learning score using the formula \\(learning.score =\\frac{(Trained.odour - Control.odour)*100}{Trained.odour + control.odour}\\). A value of 0 represents an even split of flies between both odours. We can convert this to the proportion scale, where this even split now = 0.5.\nWe can transform our data using the following formula:\n\\(normalised.learning.score = \\frac{learning.score - min(learning.score)}{max(learing.score) - min(learning.score)}\\)\n\n\nShow the code\n## Punishment learning\n\nAppel_2016_memory_punishment &lt;- read_csv(\"data/data_collation/input/Raw_data_files/Appel_2016_memory_learning.csv\") %&gt;% \n  filter(Test == \"Punishment\",\n         memory_score != \"-\") %&gt;% \n  mutate(line = as.factor(line),\n         Group_ID = as.factor(Group_ID),\n         Sex = as.factor(Sex),\n         memory_score = as.numeric(memory_score),\n         # ok here's our normalising step.

To model this data we fit a survival model, specifying a weibull distribution.\nTo model insemination capacity Dean et al specify a quasipoisson distribution family because they treat the data as underdispersed counts. There is no family like this in brms. However, we can treat the data as binomial, with each female treated as a YES/NO for mating success.

This is because some lines are resistant to parathion, leading to heavy sensoring. This results in two groups of lines: those that are susceptible and those that are resistant. The resistant lines have estimated mean survival times of 400+ days, which is not realistic for D. melanogaster. Therefore, I instead model resistance to parathion using a binomial response, which describes whether the line had surviving flies 48 hours after exposure to parathion.\n\n\nShow the code\n# Deltamethrin\n\nDuneau_2018_deltamethrin_data &lt;- read_csv(\"data/data_collation/input/Raw_data_files/Duneau_2018/Duneau_2018_deltamethrin.csv\") %&gt;% \n   mutate(line = str_remove(DGRP_lines, \"line_\"),\n          Experiment = as.factor(Experiment),\n          line = as.factor(line)) %&gt;% \n  filter(Sample.size != \"NA\")\n\ndeltamethrin_model &lt;-\n  brm(Delta_Alive.at.48h | trials(Sample.size) ~ 1  + Experiment + (1|line),\n      data = Duneau_2018_deltamethrin_data,\n      prior = c(prior(normal(0, 0.5), class = Intercept),\n                prior(normal(0, 0.5), class = b),\n                prior(exponential(1), class = sd)),\n      family = binomial(),\n      iter = 10000, warmup = 4000, chains = 4, cores = 4,\n      seed = 2, file = \"fits/raw_data_fits/deltamethrin.model\",\n      control = list(adapt_delta = 0.95, max_treedepth = 10))\n\n#pp_check(deltamethrin_model)\n\nnew_data_Duneau &lt;-\n  tibble(line = Duneau_2018_deltamethrin_data$line,\n         Experiment = \"Exp 1\",\n         Sample.size = 1) %&gt;% \n  distinct(line, Experiment, Sample.size)\n\n\nfitted_deltamethrin &lt;- fitted(deltamethrin_model,\n       newdata = new_data_Duneau,\n       allow_new_levels = TRUE) %&gt;% \n  as_tibble()\n\ndeltamethrin_line_means &lt;- tibble(new_data_Duneau, fitted_deltamethrin) %&gt;%\n  mutate(Trait = \"deltamethrin.resistance.m\",\n         Sex = \"Male\",\n         Reference = \"Duneau et al (2018) G3\",\n         `Trait guild` = \"Insecticide response\",\n         `Trait description` = \"Mean survival 48 hours after exposure to deltamethrin, a pyrethroid pesticide.
